      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>Big Horn is a close-knit Wyoming community that values <strong>youth</strong>, <strong>health</strong>, and <strong>connection</strong>. However, the community faces a growing challenge:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No local indoor recreation facility, impacting youth through senior citizens.</li>
        <li>Limited space for Early Childhood programs, which continue to grow.</li>
	<li>Harsh climate conditions many months out of the year limit utilization of outdoor recreation facilities.</li>
        <li>Lack of a central hub for connection and engagement - outside of our schools.</li>
